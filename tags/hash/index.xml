      <description>So, I&#39;ve been needing a hash function for various purposes, lately. None of the existing hash functions I could find were sufficient for my needs, so I went and designed my own. These are my notes on the design of hash functions.
What is a hash function really? Hash functions are functions which maps a infinite domain to a finite codomain. Two elements in the domain, \(a, b\) are said to collide if \(h(a) = h(b)\).</description>
