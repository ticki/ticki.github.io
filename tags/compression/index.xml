      <description>LZ4 is a really fast compression algorithm with a reasonable compression ratio, but unfortunately there is limited documentation on how it works. The only explanation (not spec, explanation) can be found on the author&#39;s blog, but I think it is less of an explanation and more of an informal specification.
This blog post tries to explain it such that anybody (even new beginners) can understand and implement it.
Linear small-integer code (LSIC) The first part of LZ4 we need to explain is a smart but simple integer encoder.</description>
