      <description>Collision resolution Hash collisions in hash tables are unevitable, and therefore every proper implementation needs a form of collision resolution. Collision resolution is the name of the class of algorithms and techniques used to organize and resolve the case where two entries in the table hash to the same bucket.
It turns out that the choice and implementation of collision resolution is absolutely critical for the performance of the table, because while hash tables are often mistaken for having \(O(1)\) lookups, they do in reality and theory have a sligthly more complicated behavior.</description>

      <title>Skip Lists: Done Right</title>

      <description>What is a skip list? In short, skip lists are a linked-list-like structure which allows for fast search. It consists of a base list holding the elements, together with a tower of lists maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, each skipping over fewer elements.
Skip list is a wonderful data structure, one of my personal favorites, but a trend in the past ten years has made them more and more uncommon as a single-threaded in-memory structure.</description>
