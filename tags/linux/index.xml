      <description>So, I recently broke my computer by spilling tea unto it, so I needed a new computer, and found the Lenovo Yoga 710, which is pretty lightweight and yet strong. As the resources on installing Linux (ArchLinux specifically) on this machine are barely existing, I thought I had to make this post, explaining various critical thing about the installation.
Bear in mind that all this is made from notes and what I recall from when I installed it (yesterday), so there might be minor inaccuracies.</description>
