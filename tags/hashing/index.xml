      <description>So, not so long ago, I designed SeaHash, an alternative hash algorithm with performance better than most (all?) of the existing non-cryptographic hash functions available. I designed it for checksumming for a file system, I&#39;m working on, but I quickly found out it was sufficient for general hashing.
It blew up. I got a lot of cool feedback, and yesterday it was picked as crate of the week. It shows that there is some interest in it, so I want to explain the ideas behind it.</description>
