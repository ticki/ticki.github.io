      <description>For those who don&#39;t know, I am working on a file system, TFS, which employs various concurrent structures to improve performance. Whenever you do this kind of advanced concurrency, you will meet the ABA problem, roughly describable as &amp;quot;what if another thread runs the destructor on a value you are reading?&amp;quot;
What this problem is, and how can it be solved, is what this blog post will investigate. It presents a form of an optimized form of hazard-pointers as well as an implementation thereof.</description>

      <title>An Atomic Hash Table</title>

      <description>In programs where there is some kind of global state, you will often find the need for having a key-value map; you could for example imagine keeping some kind of cache of a bunch of entries from database table. Obviously, you&#39;d just use a hash table, easy right?
Not really. Imagine that there is multiple threads. One approach is to wrap it in a mutex to ensure thread safety, but that would kind of miss the point of concurrency: It wouldn&#39;t be concurrent, it would just be blocking.</description>

      <title>Skip Lists: Done Right</title>

      <description>What is a skip list? In short, skip lists are a linked-list-like structure which allows for fast search. It consists of a base list holding the elements, together with a tower of lists maintaining a linked hierarchy of subsequences, each skipping over fewer elements.
Skip list is a wonderful data structure, one of my personal favorites, but a trend in the past ten years has made them more and more uncommon as a single-threaded in-memory structure.</description>
